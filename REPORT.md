1. Who was the top salesperson for the year?
        The top salesperson for the year was Dirk Stringer with a total of $61,022,268.45.

2. How much better did the top salesperson do than the individual who came in second for the year?
        Dirk's sales were just shy of doubling Michel DeFrance, who came in second with $36,413,772.33 total sales;
        a difference of $24,608,496.12.


3. Was there any relationship between the average sale amount for the top salespersons and the total sales?
        The average sale amount was 2.3% the total annual sales for last year.  This would indicate a low relationship between
        these two factors. 

4. How do you think the top selling salesperson gained so many sales? What was their strategy?

- Did they sell to many customers, or a dedicated few?
- Did they tend to sell a few big ticket (high priced) items, or did they focus on a high volume of lower priced items?
        Their strategy was to sell a large amount of high priced items to a dedicated few with one being the highest spender with a
        top amount of $53,039,844.00.

5. What was the top selling product for the year? What was the lowest selling? (For both dollar amount sold and quantity sold).
        The top selling product for both dollar amount sold and quantity is Mountain-100 Silver, 38 with a total sales 
        of $53,039,844.00; 15,600 sold at $3,399.00.
        The lowest selling product was Adjustable Race with a total sales of $849.60; 531 sold at $1.60.

6. What problems did you find in the data? (For example, where there any products without a price?)
        I did not find a use for the SalesID.  This might be a tracking that we can discard.  Also, I found a large 
        amount of products being sold with $0.00 as a price but were still being logged as a purchase.
